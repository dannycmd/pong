# pong
A 2D pong game made with Pygame.

I recorded data on the position and velocity of the ball and the position of the paddle while I played the game for around 10 minutes. I then made an opponent whose position is predicted using this data with the k-nearest neighbors algorithm from the Scikit-learn library.
