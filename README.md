# pong
Play 2D pong against an AI.

Game made using Pygame.

I recorded data on the position and velocity of the ball and the position of the paddle while I played the game for around 10 minutes. The AI opponent's position is predicted using this data with the k-nearest neighbors algorithm from the Scikit-learn library.
